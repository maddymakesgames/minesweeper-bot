A discord bot to make minesweeper boards using the spoiler markdown.

To run the bot rename `example_config.json` to `config.json` and put your bot token as the token.
Once that is setup just run `node index.js`

The bot has one command:
ms!start [board size] [mines]

board size should be formatted like "3x3" and controls the dimensions of the board.

mines is the number of mines.
